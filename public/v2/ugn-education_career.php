									<p>To obtain a strong foundation for further studies like graduation and post graduation, a good option after 10th is studying 12th or Pre-university Course (PUC). The selection of the streams in 12th depends upon the student’s aptitude, grade and marks. But the most important factor is one's keen interest in the subject and the purpose for selecting the course. The streams available in the PUC level are: </p>
									1. Science Stream with Mathematics / Biology / Computer / Bio-Math<br>
									2. Commerce Stream<br>
									3. Arts or Humanities Stream<br>
									<p>If you are selecting science stream, you have an option to come back to commerce or arts field after PUC. There are lot of options available for students of science stream. They can either take up conventional courses such as engineering, medical, management etc. or go for many other upcoming options in the present scenario. If you are selecting commerce stream in PUC, you can have the option of taking courses in arts field at a later stage but cannot go for science field.</p>

											<p>Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree with four years course is offered in India by a large number of government and private colleges/ universities. For admission in B.E., the students have to pass their 12th examination or Higher Secondary Examination from a recognized board in India. Further students have to pass an entrance exam which is conducted by the college or university where they are looking for enrolment. </p>
											
											<p>India has renowned Indian Institute of Technologies (IITs)/ National Institutes of Technology (NITs) which are having state-of-the-art engineering education infrastructure and research opportunities. For admission to engineering courses in India, the CBSE now conducts a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). It holds two different examinations - JEE Main and the JEE Advanced. The exams are of the objective pattern. JEE Advanced is regarded internationally as one of the most challenging undergraduate admission tests.</p>
											
											<p>The <b>JEE-Main is for admission to the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs)</b>, and some other colleges designated as "centrally funded technical institutes" (CFTIs). The JEE-Advanced, is for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Only the students selected in JEE Mains and score 75% in their board exams (for general category it is 75% aggregate and for OBC/ SC / ST class, the score is 70%) or students need to secure a place in the list of top 20 percentile of each category list in their Board exams, are eligible for appearing in JEE Advanced. There are some institutes like the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, and the Indian Institute of Science which use the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission.</p>
											
											<p>The States of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland and Odisha have joined the JEE Main system and hence, their respective state-level entrance exams have been scrapped off. Engineering colleges in these states will use JEE Main scores for admitting students.</p>

									  <p>Selecting the  right course after class 10th is not an easy task. There are a lot  of options &amp; opportunities available.   All options are equally good and compete with each other.  One should choose a career based on academics,  personality, desire, your likes and preferences.<br>
										  First of all, start with identifying your core strengths interests and  understand yourself. Choose the stream that best matches your skills. Get a  comprehensive knowledge about the available streams and then introspect  yourself with respect to each field. This will help you decide the right stream  for yourself.<br>
										  Most of the students follow the crowd, leaving behind their true  passions. Hence, in case you are planning to choose a stream just because your  favourite friend is going for it, then stop! Take a moment to have a second  thought about your choice. Remember, your best of friends may have a totally  different field of interest than yours. It is, hence, pointless to opt for a  stream, merely because your friend is opting.<br>
										  Make sure to choose a stream that matches your own interest, potential,  and ability. Do not simply go behind what your colleagues are going for. <br>
										  Now listing down the streams that you can opt for, upon getting done  with your 10th class exams.<br>
										  There are primarily three major streams after class 10th.  Students can choose between Science, Commerce and Humanities/Arts. All of these  three streams can be generally categorized based on the core subjects and the  career fields they will land you to. For instance, the science stream is  usually related to medical, engineering, pharmacy, and other such fields of  study By studying in science stream after 10th, students can opt to pursue the  further higher education in diverse fields such as Biochemistry, Bioinformatics,  Cytology, Dental Science, Genetics, Pharmaceuticals, Space Exploration,  Biotechnology, Metallurgy, Forensic Science, and many others, besides the ever  popular medical and engineering options.<br>
										  While the Commerce stream relates  to business, trade, commerce, Economics, Business Studies, and financial  sector. Few of the other elective subjects are Accounting, Informatics  Practices, and Business Communication, management courses Finance, Statistics,  and Taxation etc. Certifications available along with or after 12 or Bachelor  Degree in Commerce, CA (Chartered Accountant) CS (Company Secretary) ICW(Cost  and Works Accountant) CFA(Certified Finance Analyst) CFP(Certified Financial  Planner) CIB (Certified Investment Banker). <br>
										  However, the Humanities/Arts stream is the widest of all, covering a lot  of study fields, including Languages, History, Political Science, Psychology,  Philosophy, Sociology, Law and a lot more. The career prospects in the  humanities stream are extensive. You can choose for anything from civil  services or IAS officer to subject-oriented graduation.</p>
                                       
                                        <p>Remember that,  choosing the right stream after passing Class 10th is crucial  for every student. The recent trends are changing and gone are the days when  only medical and engineering were considered to be bright career options. Today,  there are diverse fields which you can explore, and each field offers ample  career opportunities. What is, however, important is to make sure to analyze  the educational prospects of each stream beforehand, and then choose the right  stream.</p>

However, there are also other career options  including either two or only one of the science subjects. It is hence better to  decide your future path at this stage only and choose the relevant subjects  accordingly.<br>

After  completing the course, one is recognised as Doctor who diagnoses and cures the  patient. The most important skill rather attitude one should have to become a  medical practitioner is that of service. One should be ready to serve, at any  given time at any place, keeping aside all other priorities.<br>
									      Medicine is a  field where the person should have the ability to analyse and diagnose the  problem at the soonest with the symptoms and should be free of a corrupt mind  (like extracting money from the person rather than curing).<br>
									      The best part  of the course is, after getting enough experience through internships and being  a junior doctor at various hospitals, one can always have his own private  clinic or hospital.</p>
									      
  									 	 <p> <strong>Engineering</strong><br></p>
  									 	  
									      <p>Depending on  the branch of the engineering course chosen (IT, civil, software, aeronautical,  computer science, instrumentation, electronics and communication, mechanical),  the scope also varies. Few branches like IT and Software gives a great scope to  grab a job abroad as well. With increasing industrialization and increase in  number of developmental projects in country, an engineer is always in demand.  But with the high competition levels, it is important to be the best one in  your specific branch. It is a practical field wherein, your brain should have  the ability to calculate and measure like a computer and solve the technical  issues by understanding them at the first sight. For an engineer, maths is a  part of living so people who dislike maths, numbers and calculations, it&rsquo;s better  to stay away from this field.</p>
