This is a kind of smooth succession planning for the wealth of any individual, to ensure that after his / her demise, the legal heirs get their share without any hassle as well avoidance of heart burns amongst them.</p>
                     <p>There is a general misconception that Will preparation is a complicated matter and an expensive exercise where services of experts is required, compelling many individuals to ignore or avoid this option. On the contrary, Will writing is not only important from succession perspective with a view to avoid family disputes, but, at the same time is neither complicated nor expensive.</p>

                                 The Indian Succession Act recognizes two types of wills, privileged and unprivileged wills. Privileged wills are those that can be made my members of the armed forces employed in an expedition or engaged in actual warfare and can be made in oral form as well. A relaxation of formalities has been envisaged for them considering the inherent dangers and possibility of sudden death coupled with the lack of time and means to deliberately frame written wills. Unprivileged wills are the wills that can be created by every person other than those who can create a privileged will. For a unprivileged will to be executed it is firstly necessary that it be in writing. The law requires no particular form except that the words must be intelligible and clear. The testator is required to sign or affix his mark on the will or have it signed by another person in his presence or on his direction. Two or more witnesses to the fact of the testator’s assent being expressed by placing of a mark on the will are required.
                              </p>
                              <p>The other types of will are:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>
                                    <p class="font-weight-bold"> Oral or Nuncupative Will</p>
                                    <p>An Oral or Nuncupative Will is a will which has been orally declared by the testator making it in the presence of witnesses. It may be noted that the Indian Succession Act does not provide for making of oral or nuncupative will except by the soldiers, mariners and airmen (as provided under Sections 65 and 66).</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Mutual (or reciprocal) Will</P>
                                    <p > Mutual will is a will under which two testators confer reciprocal benefits upon each other.</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Joint Will </p>
                                    <p> A joint will is a will whereby two (or more) testators agree to make a conjoint will. Very common example of joint will is the will made by a husband and wife disposing of their property under one will jointly made by both. </p>
                                 </li>

                                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Conditional or Contingent Will</p>
                                    <p>It is a will which is expressed to take effect only in the event of the happening or non happening of a certain conditions or contingency specified therein.</p>
                                 </li>

                                    <p>It is a will written by the testator in his own handwriting.</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                    <p class="font-weight-bold">In officious Will</p>
                                    <p>It is a will which is not consonant with the testator's natural love, affection and moral duty. Under an in officious will a testator bequeaths all his property to a stranger or a third party instead of to his children, his wife (or her husband), and other near relatives.</p>
                                 </li>

                                    <p> It is the duplicate of the original will. The duplicate will can be proved and probated if the loss of the original will is proved.</p>
                                 </li>

                                 A Nominee is the custodian of the assets belonging to the deceased. Wherever a nominee is appointed, assets of the deceased go in the hands of the nominee. A nominee may or may not be the beneficiary and this can be determined by what is mentioned in the Will. Any creditor or custodian who handovers / transfers the assets to the Nominee is legally discharged of the obligations. Lack of this information can often lead to legal disputes which can be avoided by executing a Will.

Moreover, the beneficiaries will be compelled to obtain Succession Certificate /Probate from the Court, which is a time consuming and expensive exercise.

                              <p>Creating a life interest in any of your properties in favour of any beneficiary is a good option to avoid the beneficiary from being thrown out of the property at any time. To avoid such situations it is always better to create an interest for life in favour of the beneficiary in the property. If a life interest is created on any property then it allows that particular beneficiary to live and enjoy the property till his or her death. The property on which such a life interest is created cannot be sold, mortgaged or alienated by any methods by the beneficiary himself or by any other person. Hence a life interest is usually created in the following cases:</p>

                                 where a husband leaves behind his widow and wishes that his wife should be safe and secured till her death in the house she lives.

                                 where a parent leaves behind a mentally incapacitated son or daughter who cannot enter into any property transactions and wishes that their disabled son or daughter is safe and secure till the end in the property with life interest.

                                 A Nominee is a Trustee (or custodian) as per law. Nominee may or may not be the Beneficiary to receive the assets of the deceased. To avoid disputes, it is advisable to write a Will in order to make a comprehensive note of all the assets as well as providing a clear indication about allocation of assets to the beneficiaries. It reduces the hassle of paper work for beneficiaries / legal heirs and avoids the instance of any future dispute over the assets.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 It is also advisable to make nomination of securities in accordance with the Will. Both, Nomination and executing a Will are very important. Transfer of assets to the Nominee gives discharge to the creditor / custodian. For e.g.: in the case of a Bank where it is the creditor / custodian of fixed deposits made by the Testator, upon release of the FD to the Nominee the Bank shall stand discharged.

                                 No; the Will can be written on plain paper of any convenient size. It is also not necessary that Will has to be written on legal size paper.

                                 Yes. Both, a registered Will and an unregistered Will of a deceased Testator can be challenged in the Court under the following conditions:
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>The Testator was not of sound mind when making the Will; </li>
                                 <li>The Will was prepared under coercion, undue influence, fraud, by mistake or by misrepresentation; and </li>
                                 <li>Not made out of free will of the Testator.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>To rule out the above conditions, the following is recommended:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li><b>Video recording of the Will</b>, on the date of execution i.e. (Testator & witness signing the Will);</li>
                                 <li><b>Registration</b>, of the Will should be registered at the Sub Registrar’s office to add to its authenticity;</li>
                                 <li><b>Appoint an executor:</b> A person 18 years and above of age, of sound mind and capable to contract, can be appointed as an executor to the Will. Multiple Executors can be appointed, one as the primary Executor and other’s as alternate Executors.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>
                                 Professional Executor: Professional Executor will have strong legal expertise and can act on your behalf to administer your Will in an independent, efficient and professional manner. It brings the advantage of having one's estate administered by an experienced expert, but also incurs fees which must be paid out of the estate. They gather all the information required to facilitate in identifying and gathering all your assets and administering your estate as per your Will, thereby assisting your family and making the process less stressful for them. Process can be fairly cumbersome and it is important to go with an institution that will be able to guide through these trying times and regulatory framework.
