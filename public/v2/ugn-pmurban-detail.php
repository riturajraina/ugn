										The Indian Succession Act recognizes two types of wills, privileged and unprivileged wills. Privileged wills are those that can be made my members of the armed forces employed in an expedition or engaged in actual warfare and can be made in oral form as well. A relaxation of formalities has been envisaged for them considering the inherent dangers and possibility of sudden death coupled with the lack of time and means to deliberately frame written wills. Unprivileged wills are the wills that can be created by every person other than those who can create a privileged will. For a unprivileged will to be executed it is firstly necessary that it be in writing. The law requires no particular form except that the words must be intelligible and clear. The testator is required to sign or affix his mark on the will or have it signed by another person in his presence or on his direction. Two or more witnesses to the fact of the testator’s assent being expressed by placing of a mark on the will are required.
									</p>
									
									<p>The other types of will are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p class="font-weight-bold"> Oral or Nuncupative Will</p> 
											<p>An Oral or Nuncupative Will is a will which has been orally declared by the testator making it in the presence of witnesses. It may be noted that the Indian Succession Act does not provide for making of oral or nuncupative will except by the soldiers, mariners and airmen (as provided under Sections 65 and 66).</p>

										</li>
										<li>
											<p class="font-weight-bold">Mutual (or reciprocal) Will</P>
											<p > Mutual will is a will under which two testators confer reciprocal benefits upon each other.</p>

										</li>
										<li>
											<p class="font-weight-bold">Joint Will </p>
											<p> A joint will is a will whereby two (or more) testators agree to make a conjoint will. Very common example of joint will is the will made by a husband and wife disposing of their property under one will jointly made by both. </p>

										</li>
										<li>
											<p class="font-weight-bold">Conditional or Contingent Will</p>
											<p>It is a will which is expressed to take effect only in the event of the happening or non happening of a certain conditions or contingency specified therein.</p>

										</li>
										<li>
											<p class="font-weight-bold">Holograph Will</p>
											<p>It is a will written by the testator in his own handwriting.</p>

										</li>
									<li><p class="font-weight-bold">In officious Will</p>
									<p>It is a will which is not consonant with the testator's natural love, affection and moral duty. Under an in officious will a testator bequeaths all his property to a stranger or a third party instead of to his children, his wife (or her husband), and other near relatives.</p></li>
										<li>
											<p class="font-weight-bold">Duplicate Will</p>
											<p> It is the duplicate of the original will. The duplicate will can be proved and probated if the loss of the original will is proved.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										By considering to write a Will, you have given the evidence that you have understood the importance of the succession planning and you sincerely feel the need to provide appropriate direction to ensure distribution of your hard-earned wealth, as per your wish. We bring these guidelines which we believe will provide you with certain necessary and important information which will be helpful to you for Will preparation

								<p>This vertical will be implemented with a concept “Land as a resource” with private sector participation for providing houses to eligible slum dwellers. Slums, whether on Central Government land/State Government land/ULB land, Private Land, should be taken up for “in-situ” redevelopment for providing houses to all eligible slum dwellers and allowing extra FSI/TDR/FAR, to make projects financially viable. Slums so redeveloped should compulsorily be denotified slum rehabilitation grant of Rs. 1 lakh per house, on an average, would be admissible for all houses built for eligible slum dwellers in all such projects.</p>
								
								<p>In second model credit linked subsidy would be provided for affordable housing. Interest subsidy will be granted for EWS and LIG for new houses or incremental housing. Credit linked subsidy component is being implemented as a Central Sector Scheme while other three components as Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS). </p>
								
								<p>This vertical is for affordable housing is in partnership with private sector or public sector including parastatal agencies in which central assistance per EWS house in affordable housing projects will be provided where 35% of constructed houses are for EWS category. The Mission will provide financial assistance at the rate of Rs. 1.5 Lakh per EWS house being built under these different partnerships by States/UTs/Cities. An affordable housing project can be a mix of houses for different categories (EWS, LIG, and MIG etc) but it will be eligible for central assistance, if at least 35% of the houses in the project are for EWS category and a single project has at least 250 houses.</p>
								
								<p>This component includes subsidy for beneficiary led individual house construction of individuals of EWS category requiring individual house for which states are required to prepare a separate project for such beneficiaries but no isolated/splintered beneficiary to be covered. Under this component, the beneficiaries who are not able to avail advantages of the above three components will be benefited. This mission provides assistance to families of EWS categories to construct new houses or enhance the existing houses on their own to cover the beneficiaries. Under the mission, the families will get the central assistance of Rs 1.50 lakhs to enhance their existing houses or construct new houses. Under the PMAY the houses will be constructed with eco-friendly technology and preferences will be given to the older person and disabled while allotting ground floors.</p>

									<p>Creating a life interest in any of your properties in favour of any beneficiary is a good option to avoid the beneficiary from being thrown out of the property at any time. To avoid such situations it is always better to create an interest for life in favour of the beneficiary in the property. If a life interest is created on any property then it allows that particular beneficiary to live and enjoy the property till his or her death. The property on which such a life interest is created cannot be sold, mortgaged or alienated by any methods by the beneficiary himself or by any other person. Hence a life interest is usually created in the following cases:
</p>
								<p>
									where a husband leaves behind his widow and wishes that his wife should be safe and secured till her death in the house she lives. 

								</p>
								<p>
									where a parent leaves behind a mentally incapacitated son or daughter who cannot enter into any property transactions and wishes that their disabled son or daughter is safe and secure till the end in the property with life interest.

										A Nominee is a Trustee (or custodian) as per law. Nominee may or may not be the Beneficiary to receive the assets of the deceased. To avoid disputes, it is advisable to write a Will in order to make a comprehensive note of all the assets as well as providing a clear indication about allocation of assets to the beneficiaries. It reduces the hassle of paper work for beneficiaries / legal heirs and avoids the instance of any future dispute over the assets.

									</p>
									<p>
										It is also advisable to make nomination of securities in accordance with the Will. Both, Nomination and executing a Will are very important. Transfer of assets to the Nominee gives discharge to the creditor / custodian. For e.g.: in the case of a Bank where it is the creditor / custodian of fixed deposits made by the Testator, upon release of the FD to the Nominee the Bank shall stand discharged.

									<p>
										Professional Executor: Professional Executor will have strong legal expertise and can act on your behalf to administer your Will in an independent, efficient and professional manner. It brings the advantage of having one's estate administered by an experienced expert, but also incurs fees which must be paid out of the estate. They gather all the information required to facilitate in identifying and gathering all your assets and administering your estate as per your Will, thereby assisting your family and making the process less stressful for them. Process can be fairly cumbersome and it is important to go with an institution that will be able to guide through these trying times and regulatory framework.
