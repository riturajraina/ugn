$content['header'] ['header_para']= 'A criminal case begins with a First Information Report (FIR), which , in simple terms, means, the first intimation of the incident of a criminal nature to the police. Further F.I.R. is the most important piece of corroborative evidence on which the entire structure of a prosecution case is built up. This is from where the police start investigating the case. Most of the time a crime affects somebody or somebody\’s interests and usually he or she is the person who approaches the police. It is in the nature of foundation of a building. The whole object of FIR is to obtain early information of alleged criminal activity, to record the circumstances before there is time for them to be forgotten or embellished. In the words of Supreme Court, “the object of a first information report from the point of view of the informant is to obtain information about the alleged criminal activity so as to be able to take suitable steps for tracing and bringing to book the guilty party’’. The probe into the crime generally begins there from. That is the reason why an FIR is sometimes also treated as a criminal complaint against the accused and contains the name of accused, the time and place of the commission of crime, name of complainant, and the date of crime? The officer-in-charge in police station registers the complaint in the prescribed form. The same is signed by the complainant and the officer-in-charge. The carbon copy of FIR is given to the complainant with seal of the police station and signature of the officer-in-charge.
The original is sent to court. Once the police conclude the investigation, the investigation report is submitted to the court and the trial begins, which ends either in conviction or acquittal.';

$content ['Tabs']['tab_4']['acc_1']['acc_para_text'] = '<strong>Bailable offence</strong>
Bailable offence means an offence which is shown as bailable in the First Schedule, <strong>Section 2(a)</strong> of the <strong>Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973</strong> or which is made bailable by any other law, for the time being in force. Bailable consists of two parts, first relates to offences under <strong>Indian Penal code</strong> and, Second one relates to offences under <strong>other laws</strong>. The second part says that the offence punishable with imprisonment for less than three years or fine only shall be bailable. Under Bailable offence a bail can be claimed as a matter of right and constitutes less serious offence. Bail means the guarantee or sum of money demanded by a Law Court. It is paid by arrested person on criminal charges, temporarily released until which time he is allowed to go free.
<ul>     
<li>Examples being a member of an unlawful Assembly.</li>
     <li>Rioting, armed with deadly weapon.</li>
     <li>Public servant disobeying a direction of the law with intent to cause injury to any person.</li>
     <li>Wearing Garb or carrying token used by public servant with fraudulent intents.</li>
     <li>Bribery in relation to elections.</li>
     <li>False statement in connection with elections.</li>

     <li>Selling any food or drink as food and drink, knowing the same to be noxious.</li>
     <li>Causing a disturbance to an assembly engaged in religious worship.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Non-Bailable Offence</strong>
Any other offence, apart from those offences mentioned as bailable, is considered to be non-bailable. In other words, offences punishable with imprisonment for three years or more are usually considered as non-bailable.

The term \‘non-bailable offence\’ does not means that an accused person cannot get bail under any circumstances. <strong>Section 437</strong> of the <strong>Code of Criminal Procedure</strong> provides the provisions for bail in non-bailable offences. Except on reasonable grounds that the offence committed by accused is punishable with death or imprisonment for life. As per Section 50(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure that where a police officer arrests without warrant any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable offence. Person arrested informed that he can get bail and arrange sureties on this behalf. Examples are:
<ul>
     <li>Murder (S.302) IPC</li>
     <li>Dowry Death (S.304-B) IPC</li>
     <li>Attempt to murder (S.307) IPC</li>
     <li>Voluntary causing grievous hurt. (S.326) IPC</li>
     <li>Kidnapping (S. 363) IPC</li>
     <li>Rape (S. 376) etc.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Difference between Bailable offence and Non-Bailable offence</strong>
Following points differentiate Bailable offence from Non-bailable offence:
<ol>
<li>In the case of bailable, it\’s binding upon the investigating officer to grant bail. While in case of a non-bailable offence the police do not grant bail. The decision to grant bail is taken by a <strong>Judicial Magistrate/Judge</strong> only.</li>
<li>In the case of a bailable, if the accused produces proper surety after his arrest, and fulfils other conditions, its binding upon the Investigating officer to release him. While in the case of a non-bailable offence, the Investigating Officer must present the accused before the <strong>Judicial Magistrate/Judge </strong>concerned within <strong>24 hours</strong> of the arrest. At that time, the accused has a right to apply for bail himself or through his representative /lawyer.</li>
</ol>
Similarly, if the accused has subjected to any misbehaviour by police after arrest, he has an opportunity to complain against the same before the<strong> Judicial magistrate.</strong>';
