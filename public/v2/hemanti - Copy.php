Under the PMAY, the houses will be constructed with eco-friendly technology and preferences will be given to the older person and disabled while allotting ground floor.

The house constructed/acquired should be in the name of female head of the household or in the joint names of male head of the household and his wife. Only in cases, where there is no adult female member in the family, the house can be in the name of male member of the household.

However, this stipulation is applicable only for new purchases and not for new construction (on an existing piece of land) or for enhancement/repairs of an existing house.

The interest subsidy is channelized through two central nodal agencies - National Housing Bank (NHB) and Housing & Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO). The apex government bodies channelize subsidy to the lending institutions and they help the eligible applicants to avail subsidy.';
